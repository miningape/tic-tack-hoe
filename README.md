# tic-tack-toe
This project is my attempt to make a basic version of tick tack toe to learn the processing programming environment.
The memenu.pyde file is essentially useless so theres no need to open it. To run the game open "tick-tack-toe.pyde" in processing and hit the play button in the upper right hand corner.
